# pytoe
tic-tac-toe in python

pytoe1.py was written 11/23/18 since I had convinced several friends to try to write pytoe since they were interested in learning python
pytoe2.py and pytoeMN.py were written 12/21/18 to see if I would do anything different with my new python knowlage. Turns out I used more helper functions and then I just decided to make a class in NM so the parameter passing would be simpler.
